        I was away at training fo most of this month, but Maya grew so much while I was gone! SHe started attempting to
        stand on her own right before I left and
        by the time I came back she had pretty much mastered it. She went to a lake for the first time and spent a lot
        of time with mom! She also went and met her
        great grandmother at her grave for the first time.
