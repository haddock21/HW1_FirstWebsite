        The first month after Maya was born was eventful, humbling, and the most beautiful month
        of my life to that point. Once we made it home from the hospital, Maya wouldn't sleep in her
        basinet for the first two weeks. We had to take shifts holding her throughout the nights.
        Finally, we were able to transition her into the basinet and that made our nights much easier,
        but she still woke up several times to eat. Speaking of sleep, she did that for most of the
        month. She would sleep through any noise and in any position. When she was awake, she did a
        few minutes of tummy time a day and, otherwise, stared at us while we made funny faces and
        showed her black and white cards to stimulate her brain. Her big milestones of the month were
        her first smile (although that might've been gas &#x1F602) and she already outgrew newborn clothes!
