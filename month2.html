        Maya’s second month was still full of a lot of napping, but when she was awake, she was much more alert. I
        started to give her bottles, to prepare for when mom went back to work. She would pass out while drinking, we
        kept calling her a “milk drunky monkey”. She would go with mom to a group at the hospital to interact with other
        babies, as well as a playgroup with friends. The Christmas spirit was all around, and Maya got to meet Santa,
        meet more family members, and enjoy a happy Christmas. I was constantly having her practice sit-ups, tummy time,
        and worked on getting good neck strength.</p>
